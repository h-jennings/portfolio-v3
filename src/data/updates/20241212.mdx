Spent the past week diving into [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) and exploring
the world of text editor frameworks. After a lot of reading and tinkering with
open-source code, I built a feature-complete replacement for our legacy
`<RichTextarea />` component (previously based on the now deprecated
`react-rte`).

<ImageContainer caption='The live component in our design system playground.'>
  <Image
    alt=''
    src='/images/updates/new-richtextarea.png'
    width={1220}
    height={478}
    blurDataURL='/images/updates/new-richtextarea.png'
    placeholder='blur'
    quality={95}
  />
</ImageContainer>
