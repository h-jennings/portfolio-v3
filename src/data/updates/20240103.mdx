For me, 2024 is going to be a year of maturing: a year of solidifying my
programming foundations, following good advice, and learning to tune out the
noise. Additionally, I want to expand my existing horizons and learn more about
backend development. I love UI engineering and still see it as my passion, but
the future is starting to feel more full-stack. I want to be prepared for it.
