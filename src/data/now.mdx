- I was recently promoted to Senior Frontend Developer ðŸŽ‰.
- Moved this page to [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/). This makes
  using MDX _a lot_ easier and worth the effort compared to other methods I've
  tried.
- Implemented
  [On-demand ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#using-on-demand-revalidation)
  using webhooks
  - Any time I make a change in Hygraph to the "Project" type, a webhook sends a
    request to an api route and revalidates all the pages that may reference
    that data.
    - [See the code here](https://github.com/h-jennings/portfolio-v3/blob/main/src/pages/api/revalidate.ts)
