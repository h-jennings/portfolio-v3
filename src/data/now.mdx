- Working a quiz for [Audible's](https://www.audible.com/) marketing team
- In the new year I'll be working the new Brand site for Audible
- Learning about Shopify's new meta React frameworkâ€”[Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/)
  - Planning on dipping my toe into the e-commerce development space in the new year. This could be a really interesting new avenue for myself and the agency I work for [Elegant Seagulls](https://www.elegantseagulls.com/) to explore
    - Studios like [Studio Freight](https://studiofreight.com/) are a major source of inspiration here. White glove e-commerce could be a thing to watch.
- Learning more about [React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) and their implications for Next.js development
- Interested in learning about GraphQL for data fetching
  - Would like to pair it with data fetching libraries like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) since they're likely to be the first libraries to be compatible with Suspense for Data Fetching
